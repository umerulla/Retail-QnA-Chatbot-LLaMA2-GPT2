# GPT-2 Chatbot (Baseline Model)

This folder contains a domain-specific QnA chatbot built using the GPT-2-Large model for a chocolate retail business.
It was fine-tuned using LoRA and 4-bit quantization on Google Colab.

ðŸ“‰ Note on Performance:
This GPT-2 version performs less accurately compared to the LLaMA2-7B model.
It gives more generic or off-topic answers and lower accuracy on validation data.

ðŸš« Not Recommended for Production
Use the GPT-2 model only for learning, testing, or comparison purposes.

âœ… For better performance:
Please refer to the LLaMA2-7B version in this same repository, which provides much more accurate and relevant responses.
